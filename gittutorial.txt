#create a repository in github, then install git software in out pc

#to create a bridge between your pc and github by using user githubusername and email by the following commands
c1--> command1 : git config --global user.name "akashdurai4274"
c1--> command2 : git config --global user.email "akashdurai4274@gmail.com"

#clonning your repository to your pc by create folder in your pc then type the command 
c2--> git clone your origin
c2--> git clone https://github.com/akashdurai4274/Git.git

#then create a another file like test1.txt
#the bridge has three section (git main folder)--->(git copy folder)--->(staging folder)--->(your workspace)
#first add your created text file in the staging folder using
c3--> command : git add test1.txt

#Then check the status using 
c4-->command :git status   (it shows the status of the file it denoted as "U" it means untracked) and the file moved to the staging folder

#Now to move the file to git copy folder use the command
c5-->command : git commit -m "Description message"
c5-->command : git commit -m "test1.txt file added"

#Now the file in git copy folder if we move the file to the main git folder using the following command
c6-->command : git push origin main  (ush the file to repository(origin) inside the folde(main))

# if we want add some content inside the file then also using the same commands after modification like
(git add file name  --> git commit -m "message"  --> git push origin main)
 -----------------------------------------------
| #Any modification --> add --> commit --> push |
 -----------------------------------------------
#The above are the basic commands

$If we directly create a file in the github it doesnt reflect in our pc folder in this we use the command 
c7-->command : git pull
